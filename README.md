# PAC2BAYES
This repository contains the Python code to reproduce all the figures and experiments presented 
in the paper: 

Masegosa, AndrÃ©s. R., Learning under Model Misspecification: Applications to Variational 
and Ensemble methods. https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08335


## Dependencies

The code is written in Python 3 and uses the following libraries:
 * [Tensorflow v1.15.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 * [Tensorflow-Probability v0.8.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
 * [Numpy v1.18.4](https://numpy.org/)   


## Reproduce experiments with real data sets (Figure 3)

Execute the following python scrpits, which are grouped by algorithm and by task. Running each script you get back results for each data set and for each different method with the same parameter configuration used in the paper.   

*  **PAC^2-Varitional** and **PAC^2_T-Variational** learning algorithms:

    - Supervised classification task: [PAC2-Variational-Supervised.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-Supervised.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-Supervised.py
        ```

    - Self-Supervised classification task with Normal likelihood: [PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedNormal.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedNormal.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedNormal.py
        ```

    - Self-Supervised classification task with Binomial likelihood: [PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Variational-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py
        ```

*  **PAC^2-Ensemble** and **PAC^2_T-Ensemble** learning algorithms:

    - Supervised classification task: [PAC2-Ensemble-Supervised.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-Supervised.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-Supervised.py
        ```
       
    - Self-Supervised classification task with Normal likelihood: [PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedNormal.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedNormal.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedNormal.py
        ```

    - Self-Supervised classification task with Binomial likelihood: [PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py](https://github.com/PGM-Lab/PAC2BAYES/blob/master/expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py).
        ```console
        > python ./expRealDataSets/PAC2-Ensemble-SelfSupervisedBinomial.py
        ```
